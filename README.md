# Projects_Portfolio
Just a collection of all of my finished projects (now with extra polishing)

Status of the project enumerates whether it works or not along with my reflection (as of Fall 2023)

## 2022 Fall
### Simulations
#### Cube Simulation
A basic 3D renderer (v1)

Status: Seems to be broken

#### Collision Simulation
Simulates a bunch of colliding spheres

Status: Buggy but functional (has problems with offsetting at certain gravity values, no GUI, ...)

#### Pathfinders
Simulates one of three different pathfinding algorithms

Status: Non-optimized but functional

## 2023 Spring
### Simulations
#### Boids
My implementation of boids (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)

Status: Functional with one major bug (atan calculation is off)

#### Renderer
A slightly better 3D renderer with a placement GUI (v2)

Status: Functional with a few bugs (movement normalization, occlusion clipping)

## 2023 Summer
I'm currently in the process of porting/doing cleanup on projects from here onward
