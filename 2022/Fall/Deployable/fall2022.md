## Simulations
### Cube Simulation:
A basic 3D renderer (v1)  
Status: Seems to be broken
<!-- ![][cube simulation gif] -->

### Collision Simulation:
Simulates a bunch of colliding spheres  
Status: Buggy but functional (has problems with offsetting at certain gravity values, no GUI, ...)

### Pathfinders:
Simulates one of three different pathfinding algorithms  
Status: Non-optimized but functional
