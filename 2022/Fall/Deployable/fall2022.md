## Simulations
### Cube Simulation:
A basic 3D renderer (v1)  
Status: Seems to actually be working!  
<details><summary>
    Controls
</summary>
    To run: python 2022/Fall/Simulations/cube_sim/cube_sim.py  
    In GUI:  
    * Space - Enter cube  
    * Shift/Ctrl - Layer up/down  
    * Escape - Exit GUI to simulation  
    In simulation:  
    * Up/Down - Rotate static x  
    * Right/Left - Rotate dynamic y  
</details>

### Collision Simulation:
Simulates a bunch of colliding spheres  
Status: Buggy but functional (has problems with offsetting at certain gravity values, no GUI, ...)
Run: python 2022/Fall/Simulations/collision_sim.py

### Pathfinders:
Simulates one of three different pathfinding algorithms  
Status: Non-optimized but functional
Run: python 2022/Fall/Simulations/pathfinders.py
