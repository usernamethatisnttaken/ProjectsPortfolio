## Simulations
### Boids:
My implementation of boids (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)  
Status: Functional with one major bug (atan calculation is off -> why they sort of peel from the flock when facing at certain angles)
Run: python 2023/Spring/Simulations/boids/main.py

### Renderer:
A slightly better 3D renderer with a placement GUI (v2)  
Status: Functional with a few bugs (movement normalization, occlusion clipping)
