## Data Analysis
### Experimental Data Compression:
A data transformer I made as an experiment that takes a large amount of input data and encodes/decodes it into/from a PNG file  
Status: One single bug (*ahem* feature): Image size hardcapping seems to be broken, so it is softcapped by processing time instead. Please do not try to do 1E7+ entries, as that image's size is >10MB, and I don't want your computer to hate you

## Another heading
please remove when done
