**THIS IS VERY MUCH IN THE WORKS RN**

Hi, I'm Hudsen Mickley!

I'm a undergraduate software enginner at Rochester Instictute of Technology, who likes making wacky projects in their free time!

This site is a collection of all of those, as I'm starting to look for a job/co-op and I both think these are important to share and am a little bit proud of them.

I'm currently learning markdown and jekyll, so if something doesn't look quite right, chances are I'll change it soon

Thanks for visiting my site!
