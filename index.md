Just a collection of all of my finished projects (now with extra polishing!)  
Status of the project enumerates whether it works or not along with my reflection (as of Fall 2023)  
To be safe: I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't rip from my work when this goes public (super arrogant, I know), as I worked really hard on these and that's kinda rude. Thanks!

I'm currently in the process of porting/doing cleanup on projects from summer 2023 onward!
Currently working on adding a pages deployment as well.
